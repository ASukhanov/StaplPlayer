		STAPL Player for Raspberri Pi
Ported from Actel STAPL Player v1.1, which is based on JAM STAPL Player v2.2. 

	EXAMPLES for MPCEX hardware:

Scan the first JTAG chain:
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODES scan_chain.stp

Read IDCODE of the first ACTEL device in the JTAG chain
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODE scan_chain.stp -poi8 -pod1

Read IDCODE of the second ACTEL device in the JTAG chain
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODE scan_chain.stp -pei8 -ped1

Scan the second JTAG chain
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODES scan_chain.stp -g

Flush the carrier board with the file ../image/CARB_U1-R6A.stp (it takes ~2 minutes):
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aPROGRAM ../image/CARB_U1-R6A.stp -poi8 -pod1

Read IDCODE from the second board in chain (Carrier Board):
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODE ../image/CARB_U1-R6A.stp -poi8 -pod1

Read IDCODE from the first board in chain (ProtoFEM):
  sudo ./StaplPlayer -aREAD_IDCODE ../image/CARB_U1-R6A.stp -pei8 -ped1
